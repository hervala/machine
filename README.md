# Hervala's ~~Patrik's~~ configurations

This repository contains my personal configurations for
things like Windows, Linux, my terminals etc. I will 
therefore not accept any pull requests or changes to this repo.

This repository originated as a fork from Patrik Svensson. I 
have modified it with my personal preferences. I really liked 
the way he used Install.ps1 to bootstrap everything nicely.

Feel free to fork this repository or use it as an
inspiration for your own configurations.

Running the scripts here without knowing what they do
will most likely make you sad and/or change your
computer settings to something that you don't want.
